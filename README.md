# Shiny

The R package __lessR__ has three visualization functions that provide a wide variety of data visualizations: `BarChart()`, `Histogram()`, and `Plot()`. Here a Shiny interactive R visualization is provided for each of these functions that illustrate some, but not all, of each function's parameters. 

To access, click the prominent green Code button, then select the Download ZIP option. In your Downloads folder will be a zipped folder called Shiny-main. Extract three folders: BarChart, Histogram, and Plot. Inside each of those folders are two R files, `server.R` and `ui.R`.

Run the interactive visualizations from one of several options. For the most straightforward method, open `server.R` and `ui.R` for one of the visualizations in RStudio running on your own computer. Running Shiny on your own computer requires the R package `shiny`. It is useful, but not necessary, to create an R Project for each visualization so that the corresponding visualization is accessed simply by opening the corresponding project. Or, if you have available a working R Shiny server, including the commercial version free for teaching purposes, then directly access the interactive visualizations once the files are placed on the server. RStudio Inc. Another server option is provided directly by RStudio, Inc. with limited free use (https://www.shinyapps.io).
